## Q4 - Can a button be a child of a button? Explain your reasoning

No. First and foremost because a `button` is an inline element and inline elements should never contain other elements, only text (leaf nodes.) There is also the consideration that a `button` is a clickable element and it could cause some weird behaviour if a clickable element is included inside another.


## Q5 - What is the most generic tag you can use?

`<div>` has **NO** semantic value.


## Q6 - What do the following achronyms stand for?

a) `a` anchor tag

b) `ol` ordered list

c) `ul` unordered list

d) `li` list item

e) `tr` table row

f) `th` table head

g) `td` table cell


## Q7 - Usually, `td` elements are children of what kind of elements?

`td` is a child of the `tr` element.


## Q8 - What is the difference between td and th?

`th` is the header row. It contains the headers for the columns of the table. `td` is for the table data.


## Q9 - Which tag makes the text appear bigger: h1 or h3?

`h1` elements are usually "bigger" than `h3` elements.

Trick question! It is true that the `h1` element is very often bigger than the other heading elements, that is only because of the basic CSS that each browser applies to all HTML. Presentational qualities should never factor in your setting of HTML tags.


## Q10 - In which situation can you use self closing tags?

When the element has no text to render between its tags; e.g. the `<img>` or the `<input>` tags.


## Q11 - What is autofilling and why is it important?

It is when the browser auto-populates input fields. This is a convenience.

- `src=""`
- `alt=""`
